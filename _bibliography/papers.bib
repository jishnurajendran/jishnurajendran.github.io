We study state transfer in superconducting circuit QED architectures in the ultrastrong coupling regime. Using optimal control methods we find a protocol resilient to the main source of errors, coming from the interplay of the dynamical Casimir effect with cavity losses.},

  abstract  = {Parrondo’s paradox is ubiquitous in games, ratchets and random walks. The apparent paradox, devised by J. M. R. Parrondo, that two losing games A and B can produce a winning outcome has been adapted in many physical and biological systems to explain their working. However, proposals on demonstrating Parrondo’s paradox using quantum walks failed for a large number of steps. In this work, we show that instead of a single coin if we consider a two-coin initial state which may or may not be entangled, we can observe a genuine Parrondo’s paradox with quantum walks. Furthermore, we focus on reasons for this and pin down the asymmetry in initial two-coin state or asymmetry in shift operator, either of which is necessary for observing a genuine Parrondo’s paradox. We extend our work to a three-coin initial state too with similar results. The implications of our work for observing quantum ratchet-like behaviour using quantum walks are also discussed.},

  abstract  = {Dynamically probing systems of ultrastrongly coupled light and matter by advanced coherent control have been recently proposed as a unique tool for detecting peculiar quantum features of this regime. Coherence allows in principle on-demand conversion of virtual photons dressing the entangled eigenstates of the system to real ones, with unitary efficiency and remarkable robustness. Here, we study this effect in the presence of decoherence, showing that also in far from ideal regimes is it possible to probe such peculiar features.},

  abstract  = {We consider a three-node fully connected network (Delta network) showing that a coherent population trapping phenomenon occurs, generalizing results for the Lambda network known to support a dark state. Transport in such structures provides signatures of detrapping, which can be triggered by external controls. In the presence of an environment it turns out to be sensitive to its Markovianity. Adiabatic modulation of the system's parameters may yield coherent population transfer, analogous to the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage phenomenon. Robustness of this protocol against non-adiabatic transitions is studied. Coherent nanostructures where these phenomena are relevant for quantum transport and quantum protocols are suggested.},
