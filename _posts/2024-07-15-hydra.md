# Hydra game 
## Rules

1.  There are Rooted graphs
    a. Every node has a single parent node
    b. Leaf is a node which is furthest with only one edge to its parent
2.  Pick a leaf x
3.  Pick an integer n
4.  Remove x
5.  Add a new n branches to x's grandparent


## Example
We consider the following rooted graph with root 1 and 3 branches from \(1\) $\to$ [2 3 4 ]
Then from each [2 3 4] 3 more branches as shown in the Fig[Hydra head][fig-hydra-heads]

<a id="fig-hydra-heads"></a>
<div class="row mt-3">
  <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
      {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/hydra-heads.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
  </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Heads of Hydra.
</div>
