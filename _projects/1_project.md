Quantum optimal control techniques enables us to perform quantum operations with qubit optimally.
This is achieved through the application of control pulses to control the evolution of our qubit-qubit systems.
The sensitive nature of the quantum systems require us to use pulses which are carefully engineered within the realistic limits. Such quantum systems also have certain requirements more than just the desired evolution, commonly coherent time limit, noise mitigation and error handling. Quantum optimal control methods provides us with the required framework to handle such problems efficiently and provides us with insights into out system dynamics.
